# FlightyFlock Travel Agency

## Setup/Installation:

1. First clone the repository into desired directory. 
2. Then, `cd` into the directory, and run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
3. After that, run `npm start` to start a local server and initialize webpack compiler.
4. Application should now be viewable on browser by typing `http://localhost:8080/` in address line ** Note: Terminal window should remain open **
5. Testing for this application can be achieved by running `npm test` in your terminal, all dependencies for testing will already be installed.

## Abstract 

- This was a project during my time at Turing School of Software. This is the final solo capstone project of the second six week module of the program. This is the halfway point of this program's curriculum. During this six weeks, we were introduced to SASS, and testing spies; Additionally, we further expolored the concepts behind OOP, namely class inheratence, in JavaScript. Lastly, we begun working with APIs. This project was meant to synthisize all these concepts by creating a travel agency web app, where trips can be added by a traveler to be approved by the agency. 

- To demostrate understanding of inheretance and OOP, to me the larger learing objectives, I used an user class with some base methods from which more spefic methods are based within the subclasses of traveler and agency. Additionally, I used a DOM updates class and API fetch class, to further seperate functionality. My goal was to keep the index.js file as succint as possible, more notes on that later.

## Challenges and Wins 

#### Challenges

- Most of the challenges were self imposed; I greatly overestimated my abilities. 

- This led me to exploring new technologies for far too long early in the project.

- First and foremost, my understading of chai spies. I thought I was structuring my data and script in such a way that would make chai spies easy and decided to leave these to the last day. Alas, I was sorely mistaken, and I am back to questioning what I know. 

- I tried adopting two outside technologies inside my project: moment.js and a SASS carousel I found on codepen. Both appeared approachable at first glance, but when trying to adapt them to my own project not understanding the granular details on how they worked held me back. There are some subtleties to SASS that really point out some of my CSS weaknesses, and point out how powerful it can be. Only excited to explore it further. 

- It's unfortunate that I wasn't quite able to hack the moment.js package, but I explored it enough to want to revisit it in the future to more easily adapt to future projects. On the bright side, I realized that the native JS Date object is actually more powerfull than I thought.  

- Even though I am super proud of my determination to adpot a notoriously difficult technology (vim) to edit my code, it probably was too big a mental load, which eventually prevented me from achiving the kind of work I am able to, and want to, create.  

### Wins

- I was able to use a concept I learned from my week-long hiatus into functional programming. Albeit, this did not make testing with spies any easier than I thought it would.  

- I exclusively used vim editor to create this project. This was more a personal challange, as it does reflect in any way my understading of JavaScript, and most likely led to a missed learning opportunity around chai spies. On the other hand, I feel more comfortable within my terminal environment, and navigating my machine with only the keyboard. While I may still code at a much slower pace inside vim than VSCode, my previous editor, I feel the continuous emphais on keyboard navigation will only benifit my coding speed/debugging on the long run. 

- Using vim, and being unfamiliar with it, made any insertion a meaningful action bringing additional awareness to the code I was typing. I thought this added mental awereness to each object I worked with, and, while my current slower overall speed kept me from eventually reflecting this on a tests file with approprite test, it was helpful to slow down and will hopefully show on the long run. 

## Take Away

- Don't try to adopt any new technologies within meaningful project, and do what you know what to do really well instead. 

- Use less meaningful projects to explore different technologies that you want to adopt in the future.

- Focus on the curriculum, too much of these last weeks have been spent exploring niche topics like recursions, functional programming, and. lastly, vim editor. There will be plenty of time in the future to explore these topics.
